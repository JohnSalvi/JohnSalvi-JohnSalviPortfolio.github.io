This is my current portfolio inspired by HTML5UP, you should 100% check out their website if you want some cool looking CSS that can work well for a ton of different applications, I chose to use their materials to make what was going to be a display of class projects, but I quickly realized that this wouldn't work as these projects are suppossed to say hidden from future students in the classes that I took, so for the time being links to projects on my webpage shouldn't all be working and that is fine. 

I hope to revise the webpage soont to incorporate descriptions of what types of code I used and how I learned unique computer science skills from each project very soon.

Thanks,
